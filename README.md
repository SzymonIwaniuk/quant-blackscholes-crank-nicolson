Improving Stability and Efficiency in Quantitative Option Pricing via Crank–Nicolson Method

This project implements and compares explicit, implicit, and Crank–Nicolson finite-difference solvers for the Black–Scholes equation to improve numerical stability and computational efficiency in quantitative option pricing.
It is based on and extends the work from “Black-Scholes Model, comparison between Analytical Solution and Numerical Analysis” (arXiv:2510.27277
), introducing performance optimizations and convergence analysis.
